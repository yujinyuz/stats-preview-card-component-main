## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's really better to approach this with mobile first since it's much easier to add media query
overrides for desktop.


I also learned that you need to add height to html and body in order for `height: 100%` to work.
Because it takes the height from the parent node. I'm not quite sure if there are other approaches
that are better but still, this one kinda works for me and I'm okay with it.
